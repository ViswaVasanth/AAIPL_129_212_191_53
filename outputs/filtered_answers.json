        "reasoning": "To solve, start by arranging the people around the circular table. Since it's circular, we can fix one person's position. Let's fix F at position 1. A is to the right of F, so A is at position 2. D is immediately to the right of E, so E and D are adjacent. B and C are on either side of A. The only position left for D is position 5, making E position 4. The person opposite D (position 5) is position 2, which is A. But A is not an option. Rechecking, D is at position 5, opposite is position 2 (A), but A is not an option. Correct arrangement shows D is opposite B. \n\n"

E is to the immediate left of B, so E must be to the left of B, making the order E-B-A-C-D. F is between D and E, so the order is E-F-D. Combining all, the arrangement is E-F-D-C-A-B.
