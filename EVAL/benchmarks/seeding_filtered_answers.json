If David is a liar, then the statement is false, meaning neither is a liar. This creates a contradiction unless Devon is a liar. Thus, David must be a liar, and Devon must be a truth-teller.

If she is a liar, her statement is false, meaning at least one part is false. This could mean she is not a liar (so she is a truth-teller) or Ellie is not a truth-teller. Since the statement's truth value leads to a contradiction if Elizabeth is a truth-teller, she must be a liar. Ellie's status cannot be determined definitively. \n\n"

But if Hannah is a truth-teller, this would be a contradiction. Therefore, Hannah must be a liar. If she is a liar, her statement is false, meaning Gregory and Hannah are both truth-tellers. This is a contradiction, so Gregory must be a liar. \n\n"

Jessica says \"We're both from the same family.\" If Izzie is a truth-teller, then Jessica's statement could be true or false. If Izzie is a liar, then Jessica's statement is false. Since we don't have external info, the only certain fact is that at least one is telling the truth. \n\n"

If John is lying, then Jennifer is telling the truth. This creates a contradiction unless exactly one is telling the truth. Thus, the correct answer is D) Exactly one of them is telling the truth.\n\n"

If Josh is a liar, his statement is false, so at least one of them is a liar. Karina says \"Josh isn't lying,\" which would be false if Josh is a liar. This creates a contradiction if both are liars. Thus, the only consistent scenario is that both are truth-tellers.\n\n"

If Kaitlyn is a liar (Option B), her statement \"I always tell the truth\" is false, which is consistent. Lorna's statement \"Kaitlyn is lying right now\" would be true, making Lorna a truth-teller, which is also consistent.  \n3. Option C is invalid because both cannot be truth-tellers if Lorna claims Kaitlyn is lying.  \n4.

This satisfies the condition. If Andrew is wearing the blue shirt, then the blue-shirted man is telling the truth, but the red-shirted man's statement would be false, also satisfying the condition.
