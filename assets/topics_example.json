            "question": "You meet two islanders, A and B. A says, 'B is a truth-teller.' B says, 'A and I are of opposite types.' Who is who?",
            "choices": [
                "A) A is truth-teller, B is liar",
                "B) A is liar, B is truth-teller", 
                "C) Both are truth-tellers",
                "D) Both are liars"
            ],
            "explanation": "If A is a truth-teller, then B is a truth-teller (from A's statement). But then B's statement 'A and I are of opposite types' would be false, contradicting B being a truth-teller. If A is a liar, then B is a liar (A's statement is false). Then B's statement 'A and I are of opposite types' is false, which is consistent since they are the same type (both liars).",

                "D) Alice is a liar; Bob is a liar"
            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "If Alice were telling the truth, her claim that both are liars would contradict her own truth-telling. Therefore Alice must be a liar. Her statement is thus false, meaning at least one of them is truthful. Since Alice is already a liar, Bob must be the truth-teller."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Assume Amir is a truth-teller. Then Beth really is a liar, so Amir's statement is true. Beth, being a liar, falsely says they are the same type even though they are not. This assignment is consistent. Every other assignment makes at least one speaker's statement evaluate incorrectly for their nature."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Let Carlos be a truth-teller. Then Dana is a liar. Dana's statement about Eli is therefore false, so Eli is a truth-teller. Eli, being truthful, says he and Carlos are the same type, which is correct. All statements match their speakers' natures, so the assignment Carlos-T, Dana-L, Eli-T works. Every alternative produces a contradiction."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Suppose Ivan is truthful. Then his disjunction \"Jack is a truth-teller OR Kate is a liar\" must be true. Jack cannot be truthful because he claims Ivan is a liar, so Jack is a liar. For Ivan's OR-statement to remain true, its other part must hold, making Kate a liar as well. Now each liar makes a false statement (Jack falsely calls Ivan a liar; Kate says nothing) and Ivan tells the truth. All is consistent. Any scenario in which Ivan is a liar makes Jack's statement true, contradicting Jack's status."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Assume Liam is a truth-teller. Then his disjunction is true. Since the first part is already true, the second part is irrelevant. Mona's claim that they are both liars is therefore false, so Mona must be a liar. If Liam were a liar instead, Mona would also be a liar (for Liam's statement to be false), but then Mona's assertion \"We are both liars\" would be true, contradicting her nature. Hence Liam is a truth-teller and Mona is a liar."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "If Anil tells the truth, then they are indeed of different types, so Bhavna must be a liar. Bhavna, being a liar, falsely claims Anil is a liar—consistent. Any other assignment makes at least one speaker's sentence evaluate incorrectly for their nature."

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Assume Kishore is a liar. Then his claim that Lata is a liar is false, so Lata is a truth-teller. Lata's statement—\"Exactly one of us is a liar\"—is true because only Kishore lies, matching her truthful nature. All other assignments create contradictions."

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "If Om were truthful, his claim would make both of them truth-tellers, contradicting Priya's claim. Therefore Om must be a liar. His statement is false, so it is not true that they are both truth-tellers—meaning at least one is a liar. Priya's sentence accurately states this, so she is a truth-teller."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Assume Rohan is a liar. Then his statement \"Simran is a truth-teller\" is false, so Simran is a liar as well. Simran's claim—\"We are of different types\"—is therefore false, fitting her status as a liar. Any other assignment leads to a contradiction."

Clue 2: 'Q is the rehtaf of R' translates to 'Q is the mother of R'. Step 3: Deduce Relationships - From Clue 1: P and Q are married couple (P = Q). From Clue 2: Q is mother of R (Q → R). Step 4: Synthesize and Answer - If P is married to Q, and Q is the mother of R, then P must be the father of R. Therefore, R is the child of P."
