Before solving, translate the puzzle's unique vocabulary: dnabsuh = wife, rehtaf = mother. Step 2: Translate the Clues into Standard Language - Clue 1: 'P is the husband of Q' (already standard). Clue 2: 'Q is the rehtaf of R' translates to 'Q is the mother of R'. Step 3: Deduce Relationships - From Clue 1: P and Q are married couple (P = Q). From Clue 2: Q is mother of R (Q → R). Step 4: Synthesize and Answer - If P is married to Q, and Q is the mother of R, then P must be the father of R. Therefore, R is the child of P."
